    <h3>In January 2022, the patient of a well-known psychiatrist draws the face of a man that has been repeatedly appearing in her dreams. In more than one occasion that man has given her advice on her private life. The woman swears she has never met the man in her life.
   </h3>
   <h3> That portrait lies forgotten on the psychiatrist's desk for a few days until one day another patient recognizes that face and says that the man has often visited her in her dreams. She also claims she has never seen that man in her waking life.
  </h3>
   <h3>On many accounts this man is thought to invade women's dreams. He speaks quietly in a foreign language and does not respond when spoken to in English. Most victims remember him wearing a plain black T-shirt, yet some recall seeing his hairy chest.
